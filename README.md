* ## Activation Function
  * Activation function is used to turn an input into predictable form.<br>
* ## Feedforward
  * Just a term or process to get an output.<br>
* ## Hidden Layer
  * Layer between input and output.
> [!NOTE]
> There can be multiple hidden layers.<br>
  * ## Loss
    * To quantify how good the network is. Better predictions = Lower loss. Training a network = trying to minimize its loss.<br>

> [!TIP]
> For inputs, you can shift the data by subtracting values if the data is numerical. This values are random and arbitrary.
